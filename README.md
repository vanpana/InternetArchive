# InternetArchive
This apps grabs an RSS feed, parsed it and stores an archive which can be accessible though Tkinter UI.

The InternetArchive fetches ABC News World section everytime the user inputs this action. It backs up the data from the current news and stores it in raw format. The user can generate an HTML based on the raw text saved and preview it with the click of a button.

The website RSS data isn't saved as fetched, instead, using regex, only the necessary information is stored in a txt file. The user has the possibility to generate an HTML with a signature (his name, date, original link etc)
